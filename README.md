# interns-assignments

This repository contains solutions for various programming challenges. Each challenge is placed in its respective folder with code files, text files, and other attachments. The programs should be executed from the root directory since the file paths are defined accordingly.

## Instructions to Run the Programs

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- `dotenv` and `nodemailer` packages installed

To install required packages, run:
```bash
npm install dotenv nodemailer
```

**.env File Configuration:**
```env
EMAIL=your_personal_email@gmail.com
PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
```

**Run Command Example**
```bash
node Challenge-4/Challenge4.mjs
```

### Important Notes
- Make sure the image in Challenge 3 is of type PNG, JPG, or JPEG.

- Ensure that the terminal is opened in the root folder, not inside the challenge folders.
